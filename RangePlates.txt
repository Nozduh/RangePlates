RangePlates
RangePlates is a simple WoW addon for Project Ascension (or any 3.3.5 server) that colors nameplates based on whether your target is in range for a chosen spell.
It’s lightweight and customizable using simple commands.

Installation
Download or create RangePlates:
Place the RangePlates folder in your World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns directory.

Enable the addon:
On the WoW character selection screen, click the AddOns button and make sure RangePlates is enabled.

Usage
How does it work?
Whenever you target a unit with a nameplate shown, its name will turn green if your chosen reference spell is in range, or red if not.
You can customize which spell and what colors are used, using in-game chat commands.

Commands
/rpspell [spell name]
Set which spell is used to check range.
Example: /rpspell Fireball

/rpcolor [in|out] [color name]
Set the nameplate color (by name) for in-range and out-of-range targets.
Examples:
/rpcolor in light blue
/rpcolor out magenta

Available color names: red, green, blue, yellow, orange, magenta, pink, white, black, gray, cyan, teal,
light blue, light green, light red, light yellow, light purple, light pink, light gray,
dark blue, dark green, dark red, dark purple, dark orange, dark gray

/rpreset
Reset RangePlates settings to defaults (this will reload your UI).

Tips
The spell you choose must be on your action bars for range detection to work.
If you see no color change, double-check your spell name and spelling, and try /rpspell again.
Some classes by default use a common offensive spell (e.g. Fireball for Mage, Lightning Bolt for Shaman).
For melee classes or Hunter, try /rpspell Throw or /rpspell Arcane Shot.
Uninstall
Just delete the RangePlates folder from your AddOns directory.

Enjoy RangePlates!
